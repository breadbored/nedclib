# Nintendo e-Reader Tools ported to multi-platform

Included tools:

- raw2bmp
- nevpk
- nedcmake
- nedcenc
- A ported version of nedclib.dll to be used as a C/C++ library. This can be imported into any number of languages that support C/C++ libraries such as Python, Rust, C/C++, Node (not vanilla JS), etc

## Why?

Because the e-Reader was a simple device to reverse engineer. These tools allow you to write ARMv7, thumb, Z80, 6502 assembly and inject code into a number of GBA games. For example, you could inject custom events into the Pokemon games.
